# KidsPost

A web app that generates kid-friendly weekly newspapers using Google's Gemini API. Pick a grade level (1st-5th), and it creates a printable 2-page newspaper with 10 real news articles rewritten for kids, each with an AI-generated cartoon illustration. Newspapers are saved locally in the browser for later viewing. Bring your own Google API key.

Built with SvelteKit, Tailwind CSS, and Dexie (IndexedDB).
